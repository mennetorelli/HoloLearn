# HoloLearn
HoloLearn is a new way of learning. Thanks to the potential that Mixed Reality and Microsoft HoloLens offer us, we want to help people with cognitive disability to learn some things that we take for granted. HoloLearn aims to improve the autonomy of people with cognitive disability in a domestic environment, and to be a useful tool for therapists and tutors who follow them. The two features currently implemented are laying a table and doing the garbage collection. In the first activity the device scans the surroundings to identify a table and then puts holographic cutlery on it; by means of the gestures provided by HoloLens the user must move the cutlery from one position to another to obtain a table properly set. In the second task the user must put some holographic waste into the correct bin. Several levels and settings are available for each task, so that the therapist can choose the configuration that is most suited for the user. In addition to the tasks, it’s possible to exploit a virtual assistant (a holographic minion), which helps the user if he doesn’t know how to act. The application is built in C# with Unity and Visual Studio.
